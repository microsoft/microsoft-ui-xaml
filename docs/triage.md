# Issue/PR Management Information

## Overview

The WinUI team manages issues and PRs in the repo using a process we call "triage". It helps us keep issues
organized and focuses the attention of the different groups that work in our project.

For more info about our strategy for triaging bugs, see how we [handle contributions](contribution_handling.md).

### Triage labels

1. New and re-opened issues are marked with `needs-triage`.
2. Issues with `needs-assignee-attention` should be investigated by the assignee as top priority.
3. Issues with `needs-author-feedback` are waiting for the author to reply.

Because many groups are involved in WinUI we have `team-...` labels to help filter issues further for triage.

### Triage process

For each issue with `needs-triage`:
* Feature proposals:
  - Triage makes first pass to ask clarifying questions. If it's ok then:
     - Spec owner gets assigned
     - Gets added to `New proposal` in feature tracking board
     - Assigned owner is responsible for following the feature process
* Everything else:
  - If author needs to provide more info, ask in comments and add `needs-author-feedback`
  - Add a team label (`team-Controls`, `team-Framework`, etc) if missing
  - Add area tag(s)
  - Add tags for type of issue (`bug`, `test issue`, `spec issue`, `documentation`)
  - Change labels to `question` or `discussion` if appropriate
  - Consider adding `help wanted` or `good first issue` to encourage community engagement
  - Add `nice to have` for low priority issues

The temporary `needs-assignee-attention` label is intended for issues which need additional investigation, like debugging or another teams input, to determine how to route them. 

### Backlog

[Assigned issues](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/assigned/*) are being investigated or worked on. This doesn't mean they *will* be fixed soon, just that they are on the short list for that person to investigate, and possibly fix. They may get unassigned.

[Unassigned issues](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee) are the backlog. 
     
### Triage queries

Shortcuts to triage queries for the team. Note that these include closed issues because external comments on closed issues may not be
noticed, so we have a bot rule that adds `needs-triage` to closed issues too.

We also need to monitor:

* [needs-author-feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/labels/needs-author-feedback)

## Bot rules

1. New and re-opened issues get `needs-triage` label added
1. `needs-triage` label is added whenever `team-...` labels change so that the new team sees the status change on the issue.
1. If `feature proposal` is added or removed it gets added/removed from the [feature tracking project board](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/projects/4) accordingly.
1. If `declined` is added, bot adds a friendly message and closes.
1. Tags issues/PR with release announcement.
1. When moving into `Front Burner` column, gets added to the `API review` board.
1. Adds `working on it` to bugs linked as being fixed by a PR.
1. Auto-merge PRs with the `auto merge` label on them.
1. Remove `needs-triage` label when an issue is closed.
1. Remove `needs-triage` when a closed issue has a reply by someone with write access to the repo.
1. Replace `needs-author-feedback` label with `needs-assignee-attention` (if assigned) or `needs-triage` (if unassigned).
