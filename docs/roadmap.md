# Windows UI Library Roadmap

WinUI is under active development by the Microsoft developer platform team.

## Development focus

For 2018-2019 the WinUI team is focused on:

1. Establishing our open source development process on GitHub

2. Continuing to extend the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent) 
for Windows apps

3. Continuing to migrate UWP Xaml platform controls to WinUI

4. Adding new features with a focus on improving enterprise app development - for example:
    * improved support for data validation
    * improved scrolling and collection controls
    * improved support for managing groups of RadioButtons
    * additional NavigationView functionality
    * a new Tip control
    * a new Ribbon control

We also welcome your code contributions, particularly if they fix bugs or add 
functionality that aligns with the above.  
See the [contribution guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info on contributing.

## NuGet releases

WinUI is distributed as official Microsoft [NuGet packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/what-is-nuget) 
which are regularly built from this repo.

New **prerelease** NuGet packages are released approximately monthly.  
New **stable** NuGet packages are released approximately twice a year.

The list of WinUI packages can be found here:

The next stable release scheduled for the first half of 2019 will be WinUI 2.1.
