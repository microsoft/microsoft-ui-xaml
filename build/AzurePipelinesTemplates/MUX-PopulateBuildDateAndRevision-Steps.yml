    # Extract the build revision number from Build.BuildNumber. This is needed to pass to build-nupkg.
    # This relies on the format of the pipeline name being of the format: $(date:yyMM).$(date:dd)$(rev:rrr)
    # We can't use those variables here (they only work in the *name* of the top level Yaml), so
    # pull them out here and set the variables for use in the nuget package version.
