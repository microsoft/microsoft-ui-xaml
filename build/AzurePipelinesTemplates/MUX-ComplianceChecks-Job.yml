#   # Does a few things:
#   # - Ensures that Windows-required compliance tasks are run either inside this task
#   #   or were run as a previous step prior to this one
#   #   (PREfast, PoliCheck, Credscan)
#   # - Runs Windows-specific compliance tasks inside the task
#   #   + CheckCFlags - ensures that compiler and linker flags meet Windows standards
#   #   + CFGCheck/XFGCheck - ensures that Control Flow Guard (CFG) or 
#   #                         eXtended Flow Guard (XFG) are enabled on binaries
#   #                         NOTE: CFG is deprecated and XFG isn't fully ready yet.
#   #                         NOTE2: CFG fails on an XFG'd binary
#   # - Brokers all security/compliance task logs to "Trust Services Automation (TSA)" (https://aka.ms/tsa)
#   #   which is a system that maps all errors into the appropriate bug database 
#   #   template for each organization since they all vary. It should also suppress
#   #   new bugs when one already exists for the product.
#   #   This one is set up to go to the OS repository and use the given parameters
#   #   to file bugs to our AzDO product path.
#   # Note: This task goes *LAST* after any other compliance tasks so it catches their logs
