    For unpackaged test apps, we don't need to run the PrepareForRun targets, because they will try to generate an appxmanifest
    and run validation of the package, which fails. Since we can't conditionally declare a Target, we reset $(PrepareForRunDependsOn),
    which determines what is executed during the PrepareForRun target.
