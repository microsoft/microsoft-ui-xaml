  Create the package layout from the binplaced artifacts for projects that specify the PackageContent item.

  The layout of the package looks like this:
  - BuildOutput
      - packaging
        - Debug/Release
            - runtimes
              - win10-x86
                  - native
              - win10-x64
                  - native
              - win10-arm64
                  - native
            - lib
              -uap10.0
            - tools
              - net6.0
                - x86
                - x64
              - net472
                - x86
                - x64
            - build
              - native 

  The WinUI.nuspec file in build\nuspecs points to this location and includes all the files in these path using a glob pattern so
  that as files are added, they will automatically be picked up.
