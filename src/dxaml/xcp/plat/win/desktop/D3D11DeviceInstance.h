//
// DirectX device management is tricky:
//   1. We can have multiple UI threads all using the same DX objects.
//   2. We can receive device lost errors anytime with things like a video driver upgrade or a remote desktop connection.
//   3. When recovering from a device loss, we need to release all old DX objects before creating any new ones.
//
// Xaml internally caches the D3D device (and other DX resources) in a CD3D11DeviceInstance that's shared among all
// UI threads. Condition 3 above means when one thread tries to recover a device lost error, it needs to clear out
// the D3D device (and other DX resources) immediately. This creates potential AVs for other threads currently using
// the same D3D device. Checking for a lost device before accessing a resource is no good because of condition 2. The
// device can be lost between the check and the access, so that the check passes but the access still returns null
// because the D3D device has been cleaned out.
//
// So we have to lock around accessing the D3D device. It's not enough to just take a lock before checking and returning
// the D3D device pointer, though. We'd have to hold the lock as long as the thread is using the D3D device. If we release
// the lock while still holding the D3D device, then another UI thread can come in to do device lost recovery and fail
// because an old D3D device still lives.
//
// The rules for D3D device (and other DX resource) access become:
//   1. Take the lock and check for device lost. If the device is already lost then stop.
//   2. Access and use the D3D device.
//   3. Do not save the D3D device anywhere.
//   4. Release the lock once you have the D3D device*
//
// Rules 1 and 2 can be enforced by the API by having the caller pass in the lock, proving that they've taken it. Rules 3
// and 4 are conventions that must be maintained in the code.
//
// *Rule 4 should be "once you're completely done with the D3D device", but creates contention by extending the duration
// that someone needs to hold the lock. We'll try to avoid contention by letting callers release the lock once they have
// the device, provided they don't save the device anywhere. It's possible for the caller to be swapped out while still
// using the device, then for another thread to fail device lost recovery because the device can't be fully released. In
// that case, we'll wait for the caller's thread to be swapped back in and for the caller to release the device. Meanwhile
// the thread doing the recovery will encounter an error during recovery and will try again next tick.
//
// It's important to check for device lost in step 1. Once the device has been lost, threads must keep their hands off
// of the D3D device so that it can be fully released and device lost recovery can succeed. It also helps make code
// cleaner. Xaml often has code like pDeviceInstance->GetD3DDevice()->Call_D3D_Method() that gets the D3D device from
// the CD3D11DeviceInstance and directly makes calls to D3D. This code assumes that a D3D device is always available
// in the CD3D11DeviceInstance, which isn't true when we're still cleaning up from device lost. Making a device lost
// check after taking the lock ensures the caller that the D3D device will always be available inside the CD3D11DeviceInstance
// that they just locked, and lets us skip a lot of null checks.
//
// The matching rules for device lost recovery become:
//   1. Take the lock and confirm that the device is lost. If it's not lost then stop.
//   2. Clear out the D3D device and other DX resources.
//   3. Release the lock.
//   4. Create a new set of DX resources.
//
// Holding the lock between steps 1 and 3 mean that there are no current users of the D3D device that we're clearing out.
// Holding the lock also means users of the D3D device don't have to check for null once they own the lock, because the
// device can't be cleaned out by someone else without them getting the lock first.
//
// Another thing we want to prevent is multiple UI threads detecting device lost before any of them start recovering.
// Then they all try to recover and release and re-create the D3D device multiple times. This is covered by confirming
// that the device is lost in step 1. If it isn't, that means another thread has recovered the device before us, and we
// can no-op. This check is made in WindowsGraphicsDeviceManager::CleanupCachedDeviceResources and CD3D11DeviceInstance::
// RecordDeviceAsLost.
