//  Abstract:
//      Defines the DCompSurfaceFactoryManager object.
//      This object is mainly responsible for book-keeping SurfaceFactory object
//      across all UI threads.  It maintains a two-level map:
//      1) A mapping from thread ID -> SurfaceFactoryMap (known as the ThreadMap).
//         This allows different UI threads to create SurfaceFactories, even with
//         the same device, and they will be kept separate.
//         Note that only UI threads make requests for SurfaceFactories today, but this
//         class is not aware of which thread is making a request.
//      2) The SurfaceFactoryMap is the 2nd level map, mapping device -> SurfaceFactory.
//         This map allows us to quickly retrieve and reuse the same SurfaceFactory
//         for a given device as the app creates surfaces.
