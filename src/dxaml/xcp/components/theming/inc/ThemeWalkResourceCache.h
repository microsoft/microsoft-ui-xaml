    //  1. During the CCoreServices::NotifyThemeChange walk - the entire tree gets notified to look up their theme
    //     resources again
    //
    //  2. During UpdateLayout - a lot of elements can enter the tree due to applying templates, and they will do a
    //     theme resource lookup as part of entering the tree. This spares ~69k ResourceDictionary lookups.
    //
    // We also cache theme resources in some additional scenarios from profiling:
    //
    //  3. During AppBarButton's VSM update - spares ~1000 "AppBarButtonForegroundDisabled" lookups
    //
    // Note that scenario 1 (the NotifyThemeChange walk) is safe. It doesn't synchronously call out to app code and
    // doesn't mess with ResourceDictionaries in a way that invalidates caches. Note that it _does_ mess with
    // ResourceDictionaries - it builds the system color resources, but that's before anything tries to read back a
    // theme resource so the cache is still empty. Scenario 2 (UpdateLayout) is more complicated, because this can call
    // out synchronously to app code, which can invalidate entries in the cache. To account for this, if any resource is
    // added to or removed from any ResourceDictionary while we're caching theme resources, we'll clear the
    // corresponding entry from the cache.
