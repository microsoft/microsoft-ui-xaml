// InputActivationBehavior is used in some element focus move operations to indicate whether the
// element focus change should also request input activation. Requesting input activation means
// requesting this island be focused for keyboard input even if a different island or window
// previously had focus/activation. In an HWND-hosted world, this means moving HWND focus to this
// island. Taking focus/activation in a Window scenario will effectively "window.Activate()" the
// window, bring it in front of other Windows on the same thread.
//
// There are some clear scenarios where input activation should *not* happen, such as when moving
// element focus because the focus element is being hidden (set to Visibility::Collapsed). For
// example, if a background Window had focus on a Button which the app decided to hide because it
// currently didn't apply (such as hiding a "Save" button because the content just saved), we
// don't want to bring that Window to the front just because a button was hidden. Similarly,
// removing an element from the tree should not cause activation.
//
// In general, there are probably very few cases which should request activation. To be consistent
// with WPF and Win32, direct uielement.Focus() calls should take activation, since this is the
// mechanism we have for apps to move full focus+activation to an element. A good example of this
// is to imagine a single top-level HWND containing two XAML Islands, where one island contains
// a Search box the app wants to focus+activate when the user presses Ctrl+E. Ideally the app can
// simply call Focus() on that Search box rather than also needing to find a separate island API
// to Activate() that island; WPF and Win32 don't require an extra call.
//
// But to minimize risk we curently only request NoActivate in cases where we're confident that
// activation should not be requested. Use of NoActivate will likely increase over time. It may
// also be necessary/desirable in the future to add a new public uielement.Focus() or FocusManager
// API to allow control libraries or apps to indicate any cases they have where they don't want
// to request activation.
enum class InputActivationBehavior : bool
{
    NoActivate,        // just move element focus
    RequestActivation  // request full input activation, moving system focus to this island
};
