# Teaching Tip - Focus Behavior

### Non-light-dismiss TeachingTip:
- When it opens, it does not take focus.
- You can manually move focus to the teaching tip by pressing f6.
- You can move focus back to the main page by pressing f6 again. 
- Focus moves back to the element that previously had focus before the teaching tip opened.

### For a light-dismiss teaching tip:
- When it opens it does take focus.
- Once focus moves out of the teaching tip, it will close (due to light dismiss). 
- You can move focus out of the teaching tip with f6 or esc.
- When the teachingtip closes, focus moves back to the element in the page that originally had focus.
