WinUI is a user interface layer that contains modern controls and styles for building Windows apps. It ships as part of the Windows App SDK.

- **Modern UI:** WinUI embodies Fluent Design to enable intuitive, accessible, and powerful experiences and the latest user interface patterns..
- **Unmatched native performance:** powered by a highly optimized C++ core that delivers blistering performance, long battery life, and responsive interactivity. Its lower system utilization allows it to run on a wider range of hardware, ensuring your sophisticated workloads run with ease.
- **Developers in control:** WinUI will never force you to update - you choose when to adopt a new version, while being ensured that your app will work great on all supported Windows version. Use C# or C++ to build great apps!
- **Built for modern Windows:** Future-proof your app with WinUI. With 1.5 billion devices running Windows 10 and Windows 11, WinUI continually expands to meet the needs of every modern device. Many of Microsoft's own most-used industry applications already use WinUI today.
- **Part of the Windws App SDK family:** The [Windows App SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK) is a set of libraries, frameworks, components, and tools that you can use in your apps to access powerful Windows platform functionality from all kinds of apps on many versions of Windows. The Windows App SDK combines the powers of Win32 native applications alongside modern API usage techniques, so your apps light up everywhere your users are.
