WinUI is a user interface layer that contains modern controls and styles for building Windows apps. </span> As the native UI layer in Windows it embodies <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/">Fluent Design</a>, giving each Windows app the polished feel that customers expect.

WinUI 2 is a library of controls that provides official native Microsoft UI controls and features for Windows [UWP apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/index). WinUI 2 can be used in any Windows 10 UWP XAML app, or in a Xamarin.Forms app running on Windows 10 using [native view embedding](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/native-views).

WinUI 3 is the next version of the WinUI framework, and the first stable, supported version has recently shipped. It dramatically expands WinUI into a full UX framework, making WinUI available for all types of Windows apps – from Win32 to UWP – for use as the UI layer.
 
## WinUI Community Calls

The WinUI community call is your monthly opportunity to learn about native UX development for Windows with WinUI.

In these calls we’ll discuss the WinUI roadmap, our status and your feedback.

You can watch them online here on YouTube at the [Windows Developer channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzLbHrU7U3cUDNQWWAqjceA).

## WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5 Preview (March 2021)

As outlined in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), we've recently shipped the first stable version of WinUI 3, which will greatly expand the scope of WinUI to include the full native Windows UI platform. We're continuously working on improving WinUI 3 and adding more features.

You can now [download WinUI 3 - Project Reunion 0.5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) to try out - we'd love your feedback!

## Using WinUI
You can download and use WinUI packages in your app using the NuGet package manager: see the [Getting Started with the Windows UI Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/getting-started) page for more information.

## WinUI features

### Benefits

WinUI 2 provides some useful benefits when building apps for Windows 10:

1. **Helps you stay up to date**  
WinUI helps keep your app up to date with the latest versions of key controls and features of [UWP XAML](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/xaml-overview) and the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent)

2. **Provides backward compatibility**  
WinUI is backward-compatible with a wide range of Windows 10 versions: you can start building and shipping apps with new XAML features immediately as soon as they're released, even if your users aren't on the latest version of Windows 10

3. **Makes it simpler to build version adaptive apps**  
You don't need version checks or conditional XAML markup to use WinUI controls or features: WinUI automatically adapts to the user's OS version

### Version support

The Microsoft.UI.Xaml 2.4 NuGet package requires your project to have TargetPlatformVersion &gt;= 10.0.18362.0 and TargetPlatformMinVersion &gt;= 10.0.15063.0 when building. 

Your app's users can be on any of the following supported Windows 10 versions:

* Windows 10 1703 - Build 15063 (Creators Update aka "Redstone 2") and newer (including Windows Insider Previews)

Some features may have a reduced or slightly different user experience on older versions.

For WinUI 3, your app's users must be on Windows 10 1809 - Build 17763 or newer (including Windows Insider Previews).

## Roadmap

For info on the WinUI release schedule and high level plans please see the [Windows UI Library Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).
