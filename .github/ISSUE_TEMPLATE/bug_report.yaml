It is best if you can either reproduce the issue in the [WinUI Gallery](https://aka.ms/winuigallery) or create a new WinUI project that minimally reproduces the issue to attach here. (Providing a simple to follow reproduction with an example project, without extraneous code, makes it easier for anyone to quickly reproduce the issue and spend time investigating/fixing the issue over understanding how to reproduce it.)
