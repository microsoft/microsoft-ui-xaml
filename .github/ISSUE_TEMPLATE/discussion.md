<!-- This is a template for discussion issues.
These issues invite members of our community to discuss any topics or ideas related to WinUI.  For example, you might
start a Discussion issue to see if others are interested in a cool new idea you've been thinking about that isn't quite
ready to be filed as a more formal Feature Proposal.

Discussion issues can also just be used to chat about non-feature-related topics, such as how WinUI relates to other
things happening in our industry, or stories you'd like to share about how WinUI meets (or doesn't) meet your needs.
