// XamlMetadataProvider
//
// This is an auto-generated implementation for this native C++ project of what the XamlCompiler would generate for us.
// But, since the XamlCompiler doesn't support anything except C# and C++/CX projects right now, we have to implement
// a stop-gap solution. This implementation is also only as complete as it needs to be to support our needs now.
// For example it doesn't support x:Class or Binding because we don't use those features. It just needs to provide
// metadata for Style/Template and even then only for the inner types that may incidentally be used as an implementation
// detail of another control. For example ColorPicker uses a ColorSpectrum control internally, the app only ever 
// references ColorPicker so it generates xaml metadata for that in the app but there's no automatic metadata for
// the ColorSpectrum control.
//
// This class is hand-written and the generated registrations for each type/property is in XamlMetadataGenerated.cpp file
// It is generated by reflecting through the winmd file and generating the code from XamlMetatadataGenerated.tt file. The 
// t4 template transform happens after the mdmerge target but before the clcompile target in the project.
